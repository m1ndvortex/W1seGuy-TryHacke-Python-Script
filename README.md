# W1seGuy-TryHacke-Python-Script
To solve this challenge efficiently, I created a Python script that automates the entire process
This script will:

Connect to the server at the specified IP and port.
Receive the encoded text from the server.
Extract the encoded hex from the server's message.
Find the encryption key by trying different combinations.
If a valid key is found, it will send it back to the server.
Finally, it will print the server's response, which should contain the flag if the key is correct.
